              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
              current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel
              I got every penny&apos;s worth.

              “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
              I&apos;ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
              people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
              free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
              thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling -
              time of my life. Since completing the course, I&apos;ve
              successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a
              VR startup. ”

              “ Before joining the bootcamp, I&apos;ve never written a line of
              code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me
              learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
              former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about
              the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
              They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
              assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
              outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
              no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I&apos;ve often referred to
              it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
              certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
              receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
